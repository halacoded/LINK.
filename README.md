# LINK. – AI-Powered Customer Retention Platform for Telecoms

**LINK.** is a full-stack customer intelligence web platform designed to help telecom operators take action on behavioral insights, predict customer dissatisfaction, and improve retention. This project was developed during **Huawei x Kuwait University Internship Program Summer 2025** and is inspired by Huawei's **SmartCare** solution.

## Supervisors

- **Supervisor Trainee:** Dr. Essam Alruqobah  
- **Supervisor Engineer:** Eng. Ali Alsairafi  
- **Supervisor Huawei Site:** Eng. Rahaf Alhasan


## Machine Learning Integration

LINK. is built to interface with a Python-based churn prediction model trained on IBM’s public Telco Customer Churn dataset. The model uses classification techniques (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) with telecom-inspired feature engineering:

- Custom Metrics:  
  - **KQI**: Key Quality Indicators  
  - **SQM**: Service Quality Metrics  
  - **NPM**: Network Performance Metrics

- ML Stack:  
  - scikit-learn, XGBoost, Optuna (hyperparameter tuning)  
  - Performance metrics: Accuracy, Recall, F1-score
